# Chatbot!

## Our favorite AI nemesis, HAL9000 vs. Dave Bowman

* Construct a chatbot that responds to various inputs from Dave
* Feel free to use the HTML and CSS scaffolds or construct your own
* Be creative with your logic and responses!
* Feel free to also change the characters and anything in the starter codeâ€”be creative!

## Grading Rubric (Pass/Partial/Fail)

### Required

* Have the AI respond to user input
* Do at least 3 different things
* One of the commands must utilize the list of people in the class to send a reply
* Use at least 1 conditional to change the response
* Leverage a for loop to iterate over a collection
* Use a random component
* Go above and beyond simple `if/else` statements

### Stretch Goals

* Have 2 or more AIs responding based upon user input
* Use a regular expression to parse and manipulate the response
* Have a conversation between two AIs (without creating an infinite loop!)

## Deliverables

* A working chatbot hosted somewhere publicly accessible (CodePen, Github Pages, etc.)
* A new git respository containing your code
* A `README.md` file with explanations of what your bot does, what commands it responds to, the approach taken, unsolved problems, etc.

## Mark's Hal-Bot v1.0

Commands
* "How are you doing?" - will respond with a random feeling that Hal is feeling
* "Good morning, Dave." - will repsond with the classic phrase in reverse aka "Good morning, Hal."
* "Do you have any friends?" - will respond with a random friend from the class list
* # activities : anything that has a number and the word "activities" - will respond with that many activities that Hal enjoys

* First pass is simple to get the core requirements done without anything too fancy.
* Activities without a number will show one automatically.
* Added a button to show and hide the commands to make it easier to work with it
